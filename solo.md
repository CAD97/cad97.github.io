## Hobby Engine

A C++ engine built nearly from scratch, capable of supporting small-to-medium sized
indie game projects in 2D or 3D. Uses a DirectX 11 based render pipeline along with
other toolkit pieces required to build a game such as physics, networking, data-driven
asset loading, and game object lifetime management.

## Simpleminer

A Minecraft-alike built in the Hobby Engine. Supports infinite generated and
user-manipulable worlds based on a chunk system and a dynamic lighting system.

## FMOD-rs

Bindings to the FMOD audio library for the Rust programming language. Provides
access to the standard FMOD API (officially usable from C, C++, C#, and JS) in
a manner idiomatic to the Rust programming language, utilizing a mixture of
code generation techniques and manually authored API translations.

## Unreal Rust Tool

An extention to the Unreal Engine build system (Unreal Header Tool and Unreal
Build Tool) that adds Rust as a supported development language for game modules.
Disclaimer: extremely proof-of-concept, and only functional for basic use cases.
